This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Mobile responsiveness

This app supports small screens (320â€“430px) while keeping the desktop layout unchanged.

- Layout stacks vertically on mobile and preserves horizontal layout on md+.
- Buttons/inputs are full-width on small screens for easier tapping.
- A bottom padding is added to avoid the fixed footer overlapping content.
- The bomb image scales with viewport width; the timer overlay uses percentage positioning on mobile.

Testing tips:

1. Start the dev server and open the app.
2. Use DevTools device emulation (iPhone SE/12/14 Pro) to verify there is no horizontal scrolling.
3. Try presets, adjust volume, and confirm controls are reachable and legible.
